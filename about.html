            <h3>Our Heritage and Values</h3>
            <p>
                Anand Watches was founded with a vision: to bring elegance, precision, and timeless artistry into the world of watchmaking. Since our establishment in 1924, our journey has been marked by an unwavering dedication to quality and tradition. Each Anand watch is a testament to the values that our founders, Dhruvil Mandaviya and Harry Mehta, instilled in the brandâ€”a dedication to craftsmanship, an appreciation for innovation, and a passion for perfection.

            <h3>Founding Fathers: Dhruvil Mandaviya and Harry Mehta</h3>
            <p>
                Dhruvil Mandaviya and Harry Mehta were two visionaries who, together, redefined luxury watchmaking. Dhruvil brought to Anand Watches a meticulous eye for precision, while Harry infused the brand with creativity and design innovation. Their partnership was built on mutual respect and a shared dream to create something extraordinary.

            <h3>The Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
                It all began in a small workshop where the first Anand watch was meticulously crafted by hand. With limited resources but unlimited ambition, Dhruvil and Harry set out to create watches that would stand the test of time. Their dedication to their craft quickly earned them a loyal following, and what started as a modest venture blossomed into one of the most respected names in watchmaking. The origin story of Anand Watches is one of resilience, passion, and a commitment to excellence that remains unwavering to this day.
